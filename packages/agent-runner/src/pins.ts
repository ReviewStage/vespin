 * `tools/oxlint/vespin/guards/agent-pins.ts` holds to these) installs
 * exactly these, the sessions (`claude-code-sessions.ts`,

 * the same Agent SDK (this package's `package.json`), and Codex's
 * app-server protocol types are generated from the same Codex
 * (`scripts/generate-codex-protocol.mjs`). A bump moves them together.
 * What a device fetches or carries of its own, a host's Node, and the
 * Claude Code, Codex, and GitHub CLI every host keeps for its agents to
 * run on the box itself, is an `AgentToolPin` checked by size, digest, and
 * signature where it has one before it is kept (`@repo/host`'s
 * `localAgentTool`). Erasable syntax alone, so Node runs the generator over
