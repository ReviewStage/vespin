-- Expand step of dropping the attachment's "saved_at" and its "attachment_unsaved" index: nothing this
-- deployment runs reads or writes the stamp, since a save of a plan's text no longer stamps the pictures it names
-- and nothing has read it since the unsaved-picture purge went (#7362). Note that the column and its index stay
-- one deployment longer, because a build migrates while the deployment before it still serves and Drizzle names
-- every declared column in an insert; a later release's migration drops both (apps/web/server/README.md,
-- "Dropping a column ... takes two deployments"). It is nullable, so this deployment's inserts, which name it no
-- longer, still succeed while it stands. The attachment table's capture is rendered again without it, since a
-- trigger whose WHEN names a column is what a later DROP COLUMN would refuse over. The attachment table is
-- written on every picture an agent shows, so it is locked first, as 20261105152259_agent_drop_repositories
-- locks the agent table: each attempt under a short lock_timeout of its own, letting the lock go and backing off
-- holding none between attempts.
